# Roku_Hacked

This is a through hack into the Roku Infrared Remote Controlled System.
This software will provide you with both a template for sending and reciving IR signals as well as 
an example of the functional hack 

# Quick_Setup_Guide
### Software_Requirements
* Processing IDE
* Arduino IDE
### Hardware_Requirements
* Arduino Uno or any AVR microcontroller with at least 5kb EEPROM (5 kilo bytes storage so probably no TinyAVR series chips...Drop a comment if you want optimization idk)
* IR Trasmitter LED ~3v
* Arduino infrared reciever module
* Resistor (25ohms-330ohms) *Lower resitance == far; High Resistance == not far
* Your hardware your sexy beast *rawr* xD
### Getting Started
* Follow the pictures (bonus points if you DM me with the PCB)
OOOOOOOOOH LOOK A SCHEMATIC...*wow*
